<!-- 
     Commenting this alert out for now, as per
     github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/issues/53.
     We can put it back when a) we know how to
     conditionalize it on the presence of some
     actual "high"-risk provider in the pagination
     group currently being displayed, and b) we
     know what our risk levels are and what we
     want to say about one(s) considered "high".

     TODO: Also, there's code duplication
     between this snippet and a block in
     ../../provider/dashboard/list.jsp (look
     for a comment similar to this one).

       providers shown are "high"-risk.</p>
