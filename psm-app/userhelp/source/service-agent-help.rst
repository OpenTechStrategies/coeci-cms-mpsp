Service agent help documentation
================================

This is documentation for service agents using the Provider Screening
Module.

Who is allowed to be a service agent?
-------------------------------------

The state Medicaid office decides on criteria for service agents.

Is it acceptable for me to fill out and sign the Provider Statement on the provider's behalf?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please confer with the state Medicaid office.

When the state accepts or rejects an enrollment I've submitted, how do I find out? Is it my responsibility to notify the provider?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Right now, this site does not notify you via email or paper mail when
the state accepts or rejects an enrollment you have submitted. `This
will change in a future version of the Provider Screening
Module. <https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/issues/341>`__

When you log into the PSM, you'll see any enrollments you've submitted
or started drafting via your PSM user account. You'll be able to see the
status of each enrollment.

Can I submit a batch submission to renew several providers' enrollments?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. Currently the PSM does not support this.

How do I change a provider's name in this system? Can I update it in one place for all their enrollments?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If an enrollment is a draft (you haven't submitted it yet), then yes,
you can click on the draft enrollment and edit the provider's name. If
you have already submitted the enrollment, then it is not possible to
edit the provider's name. `A future version of the PSM will allow you to
change a provider's name in the
system. <https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/issues/408>`__

Currently you cannot update multiple draft enrollments at once.

How do I update the contact information for an approved enrollment? Can I update it in one place for all their enrollments?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If an enrollment is a draft (you haven't submitted it yet), then yes,
you can click on the draft enrollment and edit the provider's contact
information. If you have already submitted the enrollment, then it is
not possible to edit the provider's contact information. However, `a
future version of the PSM will let you do
this. <https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/issues/416>`__

Currently you cannot update multiple draft enrollments at once.

How do I update the license/certification information for an approved enrollment (e.g., if the provider has renewed their license)?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently, the PSM does not allow you to update information for an
approved enrollment. You'll need to contact the state Medicaid office
directly. `A future version of the PSM will let you do
this. <https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/issues/416>`__

How do I terminate an enrollment (e.g., if a provider retires or dies)?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently the PSM does not give you a way to terminate an approved
enrollment, but `a future version of the PSM
will <https://github.com/SolutionGuidance/psm/issues/407>`__. Please
contact the state Medicaid office directly to terminate an enrollment.
