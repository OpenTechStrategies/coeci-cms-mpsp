# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the Provider Screening Module project?

The Provider Screen Module project is a Federal and State partnership to pilot Open Source
module development, including piloting models for procuring, developing, and maintaining
shared modules.  The goal is to produce a fully functional, configurable module that vendors
and States can freely incorporate into their systems.

## Why does the Provider Screening Module exist?

Screening providers is currently a manual process in several states.  All states need to
screen providers against the same Federal databases, so providing a reusable, modular provider
screening solution can be very beneficial.  Screening is also comparatively simpler to separate
from the rest of the Medicaid Managment Information Systme (MMIS), so it makes a great initial
target to pilot.

## Who could benefit from using or joining the Provider Screening Module?

States:
* Provide input and feedback to influence development 
* Early involvement enables easier integration with existing MMIS

Vendors:
* Shape open source API discussions
* Contribute to development: add new features
* Leverage for your product line

## What is a Provider Screening Module?

When providers apply to participate in the Medicaid program, States need to screen providers
in accordance with Federal and State regulations.  Provider applicants are screened against 
several Federal exclusion lists, including the List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), 
Death Master File (DMF), and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS).  The applicant's provider
license is also checked.  Screening is necessary to verify that providers are qualified to
care for Medicaid patients.

## Where did the Provider Screening Module project come from?

The Provider Screening Module started as part of a crowd-sourced challenge through 
[Topcoder](https://www.topcoder.com/) back in 2012.  The resulting implementation was evaluated 
by Minnesota and South Carolina, but was not adopted.  From 2016 to 2017, the 
[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)](https://www.cms.gov), with help from 
[MITRE](https://www.mitre.org) and [Solution Guidance Corporation](http://www.solutionguidance.com), 
resumed the project, performed a gap analysis on the existing implementation and developed a 
minimum viable pilot.
